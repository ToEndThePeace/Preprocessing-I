          <h3>HTML5</h3>
          <p>
            Although I began my journey to becoming a web dev with HTML 4, I always make sure to stay up-to-date with new developments.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card col-1-3">
          <h3>CSS3</h3>
          <p>
            With the introduction of CSS3, I really began to realize just how much you could accomplish with styling.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card col-1-3">
          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            Soon after mastering HTML and CSS, I dove headfirst into JavaScript, learning exclusively from online resources in my own time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card col-1-3">
          <h3>PHP</h3>
          <p>
            The next step after JavaScript in any developer's journey is obviously PHP. Though I struggled at first, I quickly learned the power of the language and best practices for implementation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card col-1-3">
          <h3>SQL</h3>
          <p>
            SQL is interesting because things that should be incredibly simple (and might be simple with MongoDB for example) require solving complex problems - and I love solving complex problems.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card col-1-3">
          <h3>LESS</h3>
          <p>
            Although I hadn't had much experience with LESS before Lambda, I quickly caught on and couldn't imagine creating a website without it.

          <h3>Academy of Art University</h3>
          <p>
            During my time at AAU, I learned about UI/UX principles, responsive design, page layout, color schemes, and graphics. These skills allow me to create sites that look better and are more accessible.

          <h3>Riverside City College</h3>
          <p>
            At RCC, my focus was mainly on the back-end side of things. In this program, I learned how to utilize JavaScript, PHP, and SQL together to create complex web applications. I also developed a love for database design.

          <p>
            To date, I'm still on the hunt for my first experience as a professional Web Developer. However, I feel that years of experience in the service industry, as well as my vigilant upkeep on current web trends, have prepared me to better anticipate and react to the demands of clients.
